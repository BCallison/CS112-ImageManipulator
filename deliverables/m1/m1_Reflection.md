This project was a somewhat challenging one. The beginning was pretty straight forward, creating the couts regarding which option the user would want.
I used code from the previous assignments to jumpstart the project, using the cin code as well as cout code to start. Then once it got to actually 
manipulating and then returning the imputs back into the file is where it got a little tricky for me. I was on the right track and was using code from pa3 but
forgot how to interpret some of it so I believe I asked you for help on that. From there it was just copy, paste and manipulate the index reference
number for the first three tasks. Then once it came to negating colors, I was confused on how to grab the value at i but thats when you helped me out 
and it is vals[i], from there it was fairly simple arithmetic and copy and pasting. The greatest challenge was the grayscale, I intially had three for
loops inside of a while loop which was incredibly messy and unneccesary, I had the core ideas down, I just needed guidence on the implementation of them
which you helped me realize I didn't need all of the for loops in order to output grayscale. Overall, I learned a lot in this project/milestone and found
it very beneficial in making clear my weaknesses which I need to focus on. (I apologize for spelling errors if there are any)
